* When working on the react app in ui/, refer to @. Not everything in this file is fully implemented, or implemented correctly, but it's the direction we want things to go. (Note: if something in that doc looks wrong, please check it with me.)
* In user-facing copy adn documentation, "Goal Finch" is always capitalized with a space between the words. Bad: "Goal finch", "Goalfinch" or "goalfinch".
