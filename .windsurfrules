# Architecture

* When working on the react app in ui/, refer to @python/docs/architecture/frontend.md. Not everything in this file is fully implemented, or implemented correctly, but it's the direction we want things to go.
    * Note: if something in that doc looks wrong, please check it with me.
    * Any time this doc informs a specific choice you make, please explain how.


# Tools

* For the React app in ui/, I'm using yarn, not npm.
* When running tests, use `yarn test (whatever) --watchAll=false` to avoid the watch mode.


# Style guide for copy

* In user-facing copy and documentation, "Goal Finch" is always capitalized with a space between the words. Bad: "Goal finch", "Goalfinch" or "goalfinch".
