# Architecture

* When working on the react app in ui/, refer to @python/docs/architecture/frontend.md. Not everything in this file is fully implemented, or implemented correctly, but it's the direction we want things to go.
    * Note: if something in that doc looks wrong, please check it with me.
    * Any time this doc informs a specific choice you make, please explain how.
    * These files are also useful references:
        * @ui/src/types/types.md
        * @ui/src/components/editors/editors.md
        * @ui/src/components/slides/slides.md

# Tools

* For the React app in ui/, I'm using yarn, not npm.
* When running tests, use `yarn test (whatever) --watchAll=false` to avoid the watch mode.

# Testing

* After any change to code, run the test suite to verify that nothing has broken.
* Also, think through whether tests need to be added or changed. Be conservative: we don't need exhaustive testing for this application.
* Check with me before you add any tests. Propose the gist of the test(s) you want to add, and get confirmation from me before you start to implement the test(s).

# Documentation

* Similarly, think through whether documentation needs to be added or changed.
* Check with me before you add any documentation. Propose the gist of the doc(s) you want to add, and get confirmation from me before you start to implement the doc(s).

# Style guide for copy

* In user-facing copy and documentation, "Goal Finch" is always capitalized with a space between the words. Bad: "Goal finch", "Goalfinch" or "goalfinch".
